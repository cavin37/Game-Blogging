	<h1><center>Pokemon Unite</center></h1>
	<p>Pokémon Unite (stylized as Pokémon UNITE) is a free-to-play, multiplayer online battle arena video game developed by TiMi Studio Group and published by The Pokémon Company for Android and iOS and by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It was announced in a Pokémon Presents presentation on 24 June 2020.The game was released for the Nintendo Switch on 21 July 2021, and was released for Android and iOS in 73 countries on 22 September 2021.</p>
	<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
	<p>Pokémon Unite is a multiplayer online battle arena game with matches consisting of two teams of five players. The game map is split into two halves, with multiple control points each. Players score points for their team by defeating non-player character "wild" Pokémon (referred to as catching in the game) and moving towards one of the control points. However, if the player gets hit by an attack while scoring, they will be interrupted, and must try again.</p>
	<p>Each goal zone can hold a certain amount of points, and once the limit is reached, it will be destroyed. When players try to go on the opposing team's side of the map, when all goal zones are active, there is a zone called a "speed flux zone", which slows down the movement speed of players entering it. At certain times in each match, stronger wild Pokémon will appear. Defeating one of these will provide the player which defeated it a unique effect based on which Pokémon was defeated. Each match is time-limited, and the team with the highest total score by the end of each match wins. A team can also win if the opposing team surrenders.</p>
	<p>Each player starts a match controlling relatively weak Pokémon. The Pokémon may become stronger and gain access to new combat skills by winning individual battles within the match. The "type" system common in previous Pokémon games, a system similar to rock paper scissors that determines each Pokémon's effectiveness against others, is absent from Pokémon Unite. However, the game includes a new mechanic to the series known as "Unite moves", which are combat skills unique to each Pokémon. As of April 2021, over 20 playable Pokémon have been officially revealed or found in the beta testing versions of the game.</p>
	<h3>Pre Release:</h3>
	<p>The reveal of Pokémon Unite received mixed opinions, with outlets discussing the game's potential to open a new competitive gaming scene to a fresh audience.The YouTube video of the announcement quickly became the most disliked video on The Pokémon Company's YouTube channel.The discontent from fans was attributed to the involvement of Chinese mobile gaming giant Tencent and the free-to-play model. Additionally, The Pokémon Company's previous Pokémon Presents presentation announced that a "big project" would be revealed soon; this led many fans to expect a new entry in the main Pokémon series of role-playing video games.</p>
	<h3>Post Release:</h3>
	<p>Pokémon Unite received "mixed or average" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.IGN gave the game a 6/10, criticizing some microtransactions as enabling pay-to-win gameplay.In response to discussions about the game on social media amongst fans, The Pokémon Company—through the official Pokémon Unite Twitter account—promoted a survey for feedback from fans to improve the game.By 16 September 2021, the game had been downloaded over 9 million times on the Switch,with over 7.5 million mobile pre-registrations prior to the 22 September mobile release.By 1 October, research company Sensor Tower reported that Unite has been downloaded 30 million times for mobile devices, while The Pokémon Company confirmed that the game has been downloaded over 25 million times on all platforms by 4 October.</p>
	<h3>Development:</h3>
	<p>TiMi, a Chinese video game developer, began a closed beta test in January 2021. This test was limited to select players in China.
       In February 2021, The Pokémon Company announced that another closed beta test would be scheduled for March 2021, this time specifically for Canadian Android smartphone users.
       The Nintendo Switch version of the game was officially released on 21 July 2021. The mobile versions for iOS and Android have been released as of 22 September 2021.TiMi plans to continue development of the game after its official release, such as offering new playable Pokémon as downloadable content, the first of which became available for players on 28 July 2021.</p>
    <h3>Graphics:</h3>
    <p>Honestly speaking, there isn’t anything special when it comes to Pokemon Unite’s graphics. It literally has the graphic design of Pokemon games on the switch with a much lower resolution and less HD textures. However, the graphics quality of Pokemon Unite doesn’t affect the overall gameplay which is okay. We think that the more cartoonish 3D-styled graphics works perfectly with a MOBA game.</p>
    <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
    <p>Pokemon Unite comes with standard accessibility settings. Players have the option to change frame rate settings, change language, and toggle other screen display settings. Also, there are control settings that players can play around with according to their game style. There really isn’t a lot we can mention here in our Pokemon Unite review, so let’s leave things at that.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the game’s cross-progression functionality allows for a lot of accessibility. While playing the game on the Nintendo Switch is the best, it’s also encouraging that the game can be played on mobile with your progression carrying over. That means you can continue playing the game when your Switch’s battery has ran out by bringing on your smartphone next.</p>
    <h3>Is Pokemon Unite worth your time?</h3>
    <p>Pokemon Unite is a must-play for die-hard Pokemon Fans. It’ll be refreshing for everyone to play a Pokemon game in a MOBA format. Even though some say that the pay-to-win aspect is unfair to some players, it’s really easy to look past it. At the end of the day, it’s a brand new Pokemon experience that fans and casual players alike can enjoy. Pokemon Unite can be a new game for you and your friends to catch up on. It can also be a game for you to introduce to new gamers looking for a more casual and fun game. Plus, nothing beats a good ol’ nostalgia trip. Thus concludes our Pokemon Unite review.</p>
