  <h1><center>Clash Of Clans</center></h1>
  <p>Clash of Clans is a free-to-play mobile strategy video game developed and published by Finnish game developer Supercell. The game was released for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012, and on Google Play for Android on October 7, 2013.</p>
<p>The game is set in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other player's villages; earning rewards, buying them with medals or by producing them at their own village. To attack, players train different kinds of troops using resources. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people, who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.</p>
<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<p>Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game.Gold and elixir can be used to build and upgrade defenses and traps that protect the player's village from other players' attacks and to build and upgrade buildings. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells. Gems are the premium currency. Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.</p>
<h3>Buildings:</h3>
<p>To earn and store gold and elixir, players must build gold mines and gold storages and elixir collectors and elixir storages, respectively. Elixir is used to train new troops, carry out research in the laboratory to upgrade troops, and to build and upgrade certain buildings, mostly pertaining to buildings used in attacking another player's base. Gold is used to build defensive buildings and to upgrade the town hall, which allows access to more buildings and higher levels for existing buildings. At Town Hall 7, dark elixir becomes available; this type of elixir is used to train and upgrade dark elixir troops, heroes such as the Barbarian King, and starting at Town Hall 8, create dark spells. To earn and store dark elixir, players must build dark elixir drills and dark elixir storages. At Town Hall 9, Archer Queen becomes available.</p>
<p>The Eagle Artillery is a defensive building first available at Town Hall 11. Town Hall 11 also provides access to a new hero - The Grand Warden, who requires elixir to be born and upgraded unlike the other heroes. At Town Hall 12, a defense called the Giga Tesla is installed on the Town Hall, when upgraded to Town Hall 13 the Giga Inferno replaces the Giga Tesla. Town Hall 13 also unlocks the Scattershot building and the Royal Champion hero. Town Hall 14 unlocks the Pet House, a building used to assign pets to heroes, and the ability for Builder's Huts to be upgraded to level 4, turning them into attack structures.
There are a number of buildings available to the player to defend their village, including cannons, mortars, bombs, teslas, traps, archer towers, wizard towers, inferno towers, eagle artilleries, and scattershots. Players can also build walls, which can be upgraded further as a player's town hall level increases.</p>
<h3>Troops And Spells:</h3>
<p>The game has two kinds of barracks (barracks and dark barracks) and two kinds of spell factories (spell factory and dark spell factory). The barracks create troops using elixir, whereas dark barracks create troops using dark elixir. These barracks can be upgraded to higher levels to unlock more troops.
Some troops in Clash of Clans include barbarians, archers, giants, wall breakers, balloons, wizards, healers, dragons, P.E.K.K.A.s, baby dragons, miners, electro-dragons, yetis, and ice wizards. Each troop has their own unique strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The spell factories follow the same pattern - the normal spell factory creates spells using elixir, and the dark spell factory using dark elixir. All troops and spells have different properties. In addition, the dark spell factory produces spells that require less space, allowing more of these spells to be used in a battle. As the player progresses, several new troops and spells are able to be unlocked.</p>
<p>At Town Hall 12, the Workshop can be made. This building can make four types of siege machines: the Wall Wrecker, the Battle Blimp, the Stone Slammer, and the Siege Barracks. Introduced in March 2020, Super Troops are troops that are more powerful troops than their original counterparts and have special abilities.Town Hall 14 unlocks the Pet House, a building used to assign pets to heroes. There are four types of pets, the Unicorn, L.A.S.S.I, Electro Owl, and Mighty Yak, each serving a different role in assisting a hero.</p>
<h3>Builder Base:</h3>
<p>Following an update on May 22, 2017, Supercell released the new "Builder Base" game mode to the game. It allows players to sail to a new island and create a new village with a different set of buildings.
In the "Builder Base" game mode, players can attack each other's bases simultaneously. The player who deals the most damage or getting more stars can get rewards such as gold, elixir, and trophies. However, the gold and elixir can only be won for the first three victories made by the player within a twenty-four hour timeframe, but can continue attacking for trophies afterwards.</p>
<p>Players can spend gems to speed up the in-game time. The progress will be much faster in this base with the introduction of Clock Tower (temporarily speeds the process in the entire Builder Base) and Gem Mine. A new hero, the Battle Machine, was also introduced along with this update. It is the only hero in the game that has a reusable ability named Electric Hammer. In March 2018, Builder Hall level 8 was released while the June 2019 update brought Builder Hall 9 which is currently the highest Builder Hall level. This update also brought OTTO Hut, a secondary builder that can only be unlocked by finishing a number of in game challenges. When unlocked the master builder can be moved between the Builder Base and the Home Village.</p>
