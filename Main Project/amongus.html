  <h1><center>Among Us</center></h1>
  <p>Among Us is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing. It allows for cross-platform play, first being released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows later that year in November. The game was then ported to the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and will release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in December 2021. While the game was initially released in 2018, to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. The timing of the COVID-19 pandemic has also been credited with boosting the game's popularity.</p>
  <p>Among Us takes place in a space-themed setting where players look like colorful armless cartoon astronauts; however, since the release of "The Skeld" spaceship, three other maps have been added in later years: the floating "MIRA HQ", the "Polus" planetary station, and "The Airship" (based on Infiltrating the Airship from the Henry Stickmin series, also developed by Innersloth). Each player takes on one of two roles—most are Crewmates, but a small number play Impostors—which does not alter their appearance.[d] Players suspected of being Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote of the remaining players, which any player may initiate by reporting a dead body or calling for an Emergency Meeting (except during a crisis). The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostor(s) is to covertly sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by triggering a disaster that cannot be resolved.</p>
  <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
  <p>Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to fifteen players, although recommended for at least five.Up to three players are randomly and secretly chosen to be the Impostor(s) each round. As of 2021, a round can take place on one of four maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld"; a headquarters building called "MIRA HQ"; a planet base called "Polus";or something based on Innersloth's Henry Stickmin series called "The Airship".</p>
  <p>The Impostor(s) win(s) one of two ways: either by killing most of the crew (to the point that they're equal in number) or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates don't resolve it in time). The Crewmates likewise can win one of two ways: either by completing all tasks or by identifying and ejecting all Impostors. Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition (if a Crewmate quits the game, their tasks are automatically considered completed).</p>
  <p>At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned "tasks" to complete around the map (in the form of minigames, minpuzzles, and simple toggles), mostly consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data.Impostors are given a fake list of suggested tasks to blend in with Crewmates. However, they cannot legitimately perform tasks and can only pretend to be doing any of the tasks on the ship. Impostors, however, can sabotage vital systems (such as The Skeld's oxygen supply), close the doors to rooms, quickly and covertly travel through the ventilation system (commonly referred to as "venting"), and kill Crewmates when standing near them. To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras and an admin system on The Skeld,a doorlog in MIRA HQ,and a vitals indicator in Polus.Crewmates may also confirm their identity through "visual tasks" (tasks that have animations that play only for Crewmates), which cannot be faked by Impostors.</p>
     <h3>Development:</h3>
     <p>Among Us was inspired by the live party game Mafia, and the science fiction horror film The Thing. The idea for the concept was originally given by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of Innersloth, who had played Mafia since he was a kid. In the original game, function cards were dealt and players wandered around a house, aimlessly, while another person secretly killed the players, drawing a finger around their neck. Most of its mechanics were still present in Among Us, but the team wanted to "alleviate the need to create an interesting home model and have someone wandering around in a boring environment". So, they decided that the game would be space themed and also added tasks, which, according to Forest Willard, programmer at Innersloth, "changed several times during development".</p>
     <p>The game was released in June 2018 to Android and iOS under the AppID of "spacemafia".Shortly after release, Among Us had an average player count of 30 to 50 concurrent players.Bromander blamed the game's poor release on Innersloth being "really bad at marketing". The team nearly abandoned the project multiple times, but continued work on it due to a "small but vocal player base",adding in online multiplayer, new tasks, and customization options.The game was released on Steam on November 16, 2018.Cross-platform play was supported upon release of the Steam version. Originally, the game had no audio to avoid revealing hidden information in a local setting, and Willard mixed sounds from numerous sound packs to compose the SFX during the game's Steam release.</p>
     <h3>Ongoing Updates:</h3>
     <p>In August 2020, the team shifted focus onto a sequel, Among Us 2.During this time, Forest Willard and Amy Liu continued to update Among Us, increasing the maximum player base, adding four servers and three regions,and implementing longer multiplayer codes to support more concurrent games. On September 23, 2020, the team canceled the sequel, instead opting to add all content intended for the sequel to the original Among Us, due to "how many people [were] enjoying [the original game]".However, Innersloth deemed the game's codebase "outdated and not built to support adding so much new content", so the team made plans to rework the game's core code to enable adding new features.</p>
     <p>The team subsequently announced their plans to fix the game's server issues and widespread cheating problem,as well as add a system for banning disruptive players. In October 2020, colorblind support for the "wires" task was added to the Among Us beta on Steam, as well as some previously unannounced lobby customization options. As-of-yet unimplemented features include improving gameplay for ghosts,adding customizable controls, a friends system, a fifth map, new game modes, and new roles.</p>
     <h3>Console Release:</h3>
     <p>Amid its popularity, Innersloth considered releasing the game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, but encountered a problem in implementing player communication, since standard text-based or voice-based chat seemed unusable. They considered a system similar to the "quick comms" system from Rocket League, as well as the possibility of developing an entirely new communication system for the game.Versions of the game for Xbox consoles were later announced.</p>
     <h3>Popularity:</h3>
     <p>While Among Us released in 2018, it was not until mid-2020 that it saw a surge of popularity, initially driven by content creators online in South Korea and Brazil. Bromander stated that the game is more popular in Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea than the United States.According to Willard, Twitch streamer Sodapoppin first popularized the game on Twitch in July 2020.Many other Twitch streamers and YouTubers followed suit, including prominent content creators xQc, Pokimane, Shroud, Ninja, and PewDiePie.</p>
     <h3>Legacy:</h3>
     <p>Epic Games featured a community-created game mode in Fortnite Creative in December 2020 called "The Spy Within", which had very similar mechanics to Among Us, in which among ten players, the others have to complete tasks to earn enough coins within a limited time while trying to deduce which two players are trying to sabotage that effort.Epic later added another (official and internally-developed) limited mode to Fortnite called "Impostors" in August 2021, which was recognized as even a closer take on Among Us, as the same basic mechanics as "The Spy Within" were used, but now taking place within an underground bunker with a layout similar to the Among Us map. Innersloth responded in frustration to this mode, which gave no credit to Innersloth. Innersloth's co-founder Marcus Bromander stated "Is it really that hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?", while studio representative Callum Underwood said that Innersloth was open to collaborations, "Just ask and if you follow some basic rules it’s usually fine". In an October 2021 blog posting, Epic Games did credit Innersloth and Among Us as inspirations for the "Impostors" mode.</p>
