  <h1><center>Clash Royale</center></h1>
  <p>Clash Royale is a free-to-play real-time strategy video game developed and published by Supercell.The game combines elements from collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arena.The game was released globally on March 2, 2016.Clash Royale reached $1 billion in revenue in less than a year on the market.In three years, Clash Royaleâ€™ made $2.5 billion in revenue according to market intelligence company Sensor Tower.</p>
  <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
  <p>Clash Royale is a tower rush video game which pits players in games featuring two or four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy the most opposing towers, with the destruction of the "King's Tower" being an instantaneous win.After three minutes, if both of the players/teams have an equal number of crowns or none at all the match continues into a 2-minute overtime period and the player who destroys an opposing tower wins instantaneously. If no towers are destroyed during overtime, there is a tiebreaker, where all towers rapidly lose health, and the tower with the least health is destroyed. If two towers have the same health, there is a draw.After an update in late 2018, leaving a 2v2 match multiple times prevents the player from playing 2v2 with random players for some time.</p>
     <p>Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles, a player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's King's Tower, resulting in an automatic "three-crown" victory (unless the King's Tower was destroyed at the same time by both players, resulting in a draw).</p>
     <h3>Cards:</h3>
     <p>Playable troops, buildings, and spells are represented as cards. Many cards are directly based on troops and buildings from Supercell's previous game Clash of Clans, such as giants and cannons, and the game uses a similar artstyle. Prior to each battle (with the exception of the first battle in Training Camp), players construct a deck of eight cards which they use to attack and defend against their opponent's cards. At the start of each game, both players begin with four randomly chosen cards from their deck of eight, except Mirror and Elixir Collector.
     Each card costs a certain amount of elixir to play. Players start the battle with five elixir points (zero in Double and Triple Elixir modes), and one elixir point is replenished every 2.8 seconds (or 1.4 seconds in Double Elixir Mode, the final 60 seconds of the game and the first minute of overtime, and roughly every 0.9 seconds during Triple Elixir Mode and the last minute of overtime), to a maximum of ten elixir points. Once a card is played, a new card is automatically drawn from the player's eight card deck.</p>
     <p>Clash Royale first launched with 42 cards, there were 14 cards for each of the three rarities that existed at that time: Common, Rare, and Epic. The February 2016 update added a new rarity: Legendary, with the introduction of two new legendary cards to the game. As of June 2021, there are 103 cards in the game, coming in four rarities: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. The September 2018 update changed card levels as not to confuse new players. All cards now cap at level 13, with common cards starting at level 1, rare cards starting at level 3, epic cards starting at level 6, and legendary cards starting at level 9. All cards are level 9 for all tournaments. The December 2018 update added Star Points to unlock special golden cosmetics for Max Level cards.</p>
     <h3>Clans:</h3>
     <p>Starting from Experience level 1, players can join or form clans. Joining or forming a clan enables the player to engage in friendly battles and clan wars. It also unlocks the feature of trading and requesting cards from clanmates after becoming level 2. Clan members can also chat and share emotes with their clanmates. A clan has a maximum player limit of 50.</p>
     <h3>Clan Wars:</h3>
     <p>On April 25, 2018, Clan Wars were added. A clan war is separated into two days: 'Collection Day' and 'War Day'. To play in a Clan War, a Clan must have a minimum of ten players that are level 8 and above. On Collection Day, each player in a Clan gets to do three battles in a variety of game modes, which rotate every month. Upon completing a battle, the player earns cards, which go into their Clan's card collection. More cards are awarded upon winning a battle, and players earn more cards in higher Arenas. For the Clan War to progress to War Day, a minimum of ten players need to do at least one battle each. On War Day, a Clan is matched with four other Clans with a similar number of participants and Clan Trophies. Each participant gets to build a deck using only the cards that their Clan unlocked on Collection Day. Card levels are limited to the player's card level and the number of duplicate cards gained on Collection Day, with the lowest level having priority. Players also must have a card unlocked in their own collection to use it.</p>
     <h3>Leagues:</h3>
     <p>In March 2017, "Leagues" were added to the game. Once above 4000 trophies, players are placed in one of nine different leagues ranging from Challenger I to Ultimate Champion.At the end of each season, players receive rewards based on the highest league achieved during that season. After the season ends the player is reset to half of the trophies they gained above 4000 trophies. So if they got to 6400 they would be reset to 5200 trophies at the end of the season. Another feature that was introduced is Clan Battles. Two players get to battle side by side with another member of their clan facing off against two other opponents from another clan. This is the first update to include a new game mode. As of November 2018, clan battles have been transferred into clan wars as 2v2 battles.</p>
     <h3>Tournaments:</h3>
     <p>In July 2016, Supercell introduced a new Tournament feature. Tournaments are similar to normal battles, but all cards are capped at level 9. This feature is unlocked at player experience Level 5, but can only be played from experience level 8. Tournaments can only be created by using gems, and the creator can choose to make it password protected or open. Based on tournament performance, players are rewarded with tournament chests. As well as tournaments, there are two types of Victory Challenges, one in which the goal is to win twelve times while losing no more than two times and the other's goal is to play until you finish the entire challenge by winning all crowns or battles, regardless of losses. A Grand Challenge costs 100 gems to enter, and a Classic Challenge costs 10. Completing (or getting 12 wins on) a Grand Challenge gives you 22000 gold and 1100 cards, and completing a Classic Challenge will give you 2000 gold and 100 cards.Supercell has also added various event challenges, for limited periods of time, that add special features to the battles, or allow players to receive special cards. These event challenges can also sometimes be played in Friendly Battles.As of the October 2017 update, players would no longer get a refund on gems if no matches take place in their custom tournaments. In December 2018 update added Global Tournaments while Custom Tournaments is renamed to Private Tournaments which removed the prizes but added more options.</p>
