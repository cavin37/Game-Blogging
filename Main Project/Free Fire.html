  <h1><center>Garena Free Fire</center></h1>
  <p>Garena Free Fire, also known as Free Fire, is a battle royale game, developed by 111 Dots Studio and published by Garena for Android and iOS. It became the most downloaded mobile game globally in 2019.The game received the award for the "Best Popular Vote Game" by the Google Play Store in 2019. As of May 2020, Free Fire has set a record with over 80 million daily active users globally.As of November 2019, Free Fire has grossed over $1 billion worldwide</p>
  <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
  <p>Garena Free Fire is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game played in third person perspective.
     A battle royale match consists of up to 50 players parachuting onto an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position and take weapons and supplies to extend their battle life.</p>
     <p>When players join a game, they are in a plane which flies over an island. While the plane is flying over the island, the players can jump out wherever they like, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the players must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the players is to survive on the island with a maximum of 50 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the players encounter along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing the surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.</p>
     <h3>Free Fire Maps:</h3>
     <p>This game originally released with one map for its battle royale mode, Bermuda. Since then, the devs have also released two new maps, Purgatory, and Kalahari. Though each of these are identical in size, they are radically different in essentially every other aspect.</p>
     <h3>1.Bermuda:</h3>
     <p>Bermuda is a tropical setting with lush grasslands, as well as several islets surrounding it. The map itself features various different locations, including factories, residential complexes, a power plant, a shipyard, hangar, and many more. This is the standard map available to everyone as soon as they download the game, which makes it one of the most popular.</p>
     <h3>2.Purgatory</h3>
     <p>The second map to get released, featuring a vastly different layout. Purgatory is a vast expanse of land separated into three regions divided by a long forking river. The northern region is the largest, featuring the bulk of the locations in the map, while the other two are quite small and make for good venues for players to fight in during the first few minutes of the match. This map is available every day from 6 to 10 PM.</p>
     <h3>3.Kalahari</h3>
     <p>The newest addition to the lineup of maps, consisting of a large desert with various interesting and weird locations. Kalahari is one of the most chaotic maps, featuring lots of good weapons strewn throughout its many regions. Furthermore, it has lots of places that can facilitate different play styles. From close-quarter battles using SMGs and shotguns to long-range encounters with sniper rifles, Kalahari has it all. This is one of the most popular maps alongside Bermuda.</p>
     <h3>Free Fire Diamonds – How to Get Them?</h3>
     <p>As a free-to-play mobile game, it’s expected that Free Fire has lots of in-game purchases and microtransactions. Most of the goods in the game can be purchased with diamonds, one of the game’s currencies, which is obtained mostly by topping up your account with real money. As such, diamonds are a premium currency used mostly to unlock benefits faster than usual.
     While there are a few free methods to get Free Fire diamonds, such as participating in special events, the most common and fastest way to get them is actually by purchasing them from the store.</p>
     <p>There are two main ways to go about this:</p>
     <h3>1.Free Fire Diamond Top Up:</h3>
     <p>Pay money to instantly receive a pack of diamonds. The amounts can be as low as $1 for 100 diamonds, or as high as $50 for 5,600 diamonds.</p>
     <h3>2.Free Fire Membership:</h3>
     <p>Pay a monthly or weekly fee to receive a small amount of diamonds every day. While it takes longer to get the full amount, and requires you to login daily, these memberships usually give much more diamonds than by topping up directly. Currently, the weekly membership goes for $2 and gives a total of 420 diamonds over 7 days, while the monthly membership costs $8 and gives 1,900 diamonds in total. Both memberships give 60 diamonds daily.</p>
